## 1. Executive Summary

### What is Norenchise?
A hybrid café partnership model combining Japanese 暖簾分け (norenwake) tradition with modern franchise systems. The name blends "noren" (暖簾) + "franchise" = **Norenchise**.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Partners:** Lower cost than both wholesale AND franchise, with full brand/support included
- **For HQ:** 161% more profit than wholesale per partner through full product ecosystem

### Key Terms
- **Royalty:** 2.5% on Tokyo Coffee-related revenue (coffee drinks, cakes, cookies, retail products)
- **Partnership Fee:** ¥0 (for first partner)
- **Bean Pricing:** Wholesale rate (6掛け = ¥4,920/kg)

---

## 2. The Logic: Why Royalty Actually Helps Partners

### Initial Goal
We originally wanted a royalty-free model (pure 暖簾分け style). After exhaustive financial modeling, we discovered this was actually **worse for partners**.

### The Discovery
A small royalty (2.5%) unlocks included services that would cost MORE to purchase separately under wholesale:

| Service | Wholesale Cost | Norenchise |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Initial setup consulting | ¥400,000 | Included |
| Support calls (3/year) | ¥90,000 | Included |
| Brand development | ¥300,000 | Included |
| Menu development | ¥100,000 | Included |
| Marketing materials | ¥150,000 | Included |
| **Total** | **¥1,040,000+** | **~¥520,000** (royalty) |

**Net benefit to partner: ~¥520,000/year savings vs wholesale**

### Why "適当" (Tekitou)
The Japanese concept of "適当" — finding the appropriate fit — guided us. The 2.5% royalty is the mathematically optimal balance where:
- Partner pays less than any alternative
- HQ earns enough to sustain support infrastructure
- Both parties have aligned incentives

---

## 3. Royalty Structure (UPDATED)

### What's IN the Royalty Base (2.5% applies):
- ☕ カフェIN (dine-in coffee + food from our menu)
- ☕ カフェOUT (takeout coffee)
- 🍰 Cake sales (supplied by Tokyo Coffee)
- 🍪 Cookie sales (supplied by Tokyo Coffee)
- 📦 Retail coffee products (beans, drip bags, latte base, gear)
- **Everything supplied by/branded Tokyo Coffee**

### What's EXCLUDED (No royalty):
- 🍯 物販 — honey, non-coffee items (partner's own sourcing/brand)
- 🧘 ヨガ教室
- 📷 カメラ教室
- 🎨 ワークショップ
- 🏠 スペースレンタル
- **Partner's own ventures/sourcing**

### The Principle
> "We earn from what we contribute. Your own ventures are 100% yours."

---

## 4. Financial Model (Final Numbers — UPDATED)

### Partner's Projected Business (Q4 Run-Rate)
- **Customers:** 80/day (40 dine-in + 40 takeout)
- **Operating days:** 22/month
- **Total revenue:** ¥2,302,640/month

### Revenue Breakdown (UPDATED)

| Stream | Monthly | Royalty? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| カフェIN (dine-in) | ¥1,056,000 | ✓ Yes |
| カフェOUT (takeout) | ¥528,000 | ✓ Yes |
| Retail coffee products | ¥150,640 | ✓ Yes |
| Cake sales (317 × ¥700) | ¥221,900 | ✓ Yes |
| Cookie sales (88 × ¥250) | ¥22,000 | ✓ Yes |
| **Subtotal: Royalty Base** | **¥1,978,540** | |
| 物販・honey (their brand) | ¥198,000 | ✗ No |
| Yoga/events/rental | ¥370,000 | ✗ No |
| **Subtotal: Excluded** | **¥568,000** | |

**Note:** Cake/cookie revenue may overlap with カフェIN — need to clarify with partner whether these are separate line items or included in the ¥1,200 average ticket.

### Royalty Calculation (Conservative: Using Original Coffee Base)
If cakes/cookies are already included in カフェIN ticket:
- Royalty base: ¥1,734,640/month
- Monthly royalty: ¥43,366

If cakes/cookies are separate revenue:
- Royalty base: ¥1,978,540/month
- Monthly royalty: **¥49,464**

### Year 1 Cost Comparison (Using Higher Royalty Estimate)

| Model | Year 1 Total | vs Norenchise |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Norenchise** | **¥3,730,000** | — |
| Wholesale (true cost) | ¥4,323,740 | +¥593,740 |
| Franchise | ¥7,324,000 | +¥3,594,000 |

**Partner still saves ~¥594K/yr vs wholesale, ~¥3.6M/yr vs franchise**

## 8. Limitations & Open Questions

### Current Limitations
1. **Quality control mechanism undefined** — Relies on trust/relationship, no formal audit system
2. **Contract structure not finalized** — Term length, termination conditions, territory protection TBD
3. **Single partner test** — Model based on one partner's projections, not validated at scale
4. **Food revenue overlap unclear** — Are cake/cookie sales already in カフェIN ticket or separate?

### Open Questions
1. What happens if partner underperforms quality standards?
2. How to handle partner exit/sale of location?
3. Territory protection specifics?
4. Multi-unit partner terms?
5. Minimum purchase requirements (if any)?
6. **Clarify with partner:** Is cake/cookie revenue separate from カフェIN or included?

### Assumptions to Validate
- 18g beans per drink (weighted average)
- 18% cake attachment rate
- 5% cookie attachment rate  
- 50% takeout rate
- Partner can achieve 80 customers/day by Q4
