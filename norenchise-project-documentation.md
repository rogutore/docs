## 1. Executive Summary

### What is Norenchise?
A hybrid café partnership model combining Japanese 暖簾分け (norenwake) tradition with modern franchise systems. The name blends "noren" (暖簾) + "franchise" = **Norenchise**.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Partners:** Lower cost than both wholesale AND franchise, with full brand/support included
- **For HQ:** 161% more profit than wholesale per partner through full product ecosystem

### Key Terms
- **Royalty:** 2.5% on coffee-related revenue only (not yoga, events, honey, rentals)
- **Partnership Fee:** ¥0 (for first partner)
- **Bean Pricing:** Wholesale rate (6掛け = ¥4,920/kg)

## 2. The Logic: Why Royalty Actually Helps Partners

### Initial Goal
We originally wanted a royalty-free model (pure 暖簾分け style). After exhaustive financial modeling, we discovered this was actually **worse for partners**.

### The Discovery
A small royalty (2.5%) unlocks included services that would cost MORE to purchase separately under wholesale:

| Service | Wholesale Cost | Norenchise |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Initial setup consulting | ¥400,000 | Included |
| Support calls (3/year) | ¥90,000 | Included |
| Brand development | ¥300,000 | Included |
| Menu development | ¥100,000 | Included |
| Marketing materials | ¥150,000 | Included |
| **Total** | **¥1,040,000+** | **¥381,150** (royalty) |

**Net benefit to partner: ¥658,850/year savings vs wholesale**

### Why "適当" (Tekitou)
The Japanese concept of "適当" — finding the appropriate fit — guided us. The 2.5% royalty is the mathematically optimal balance where:
- Partner pays less than any alternative
- HQ earns enough to sustain support infrastructure
- Both parties have aligned incentives

## 3. Financial Model (Final Numbers)

### Partner's Projected Business (Q4 Run-Rate)
- **Customers:** 80/day (40 dine-in + 40 takeout)
- **Operating days:** 22/month
- **Total revenue:** ¥2,302,640/month

### Revenue Breakdown

| Stream | Monthly | Royalty? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| カフェIN (dine-in) | ¥1,056,000 | ✓ Yes |
| カフェOUT (takeout) | ¥528,000 | ✓ Yes |
| Retail coffee products | ¥150,640 | ✓ Yes |
| 物販・honey (their brand) | ¥198,000 | ✗ No |
| Yoga/events/rental | ¥370,000 | ✗ No |

**Royalty base:** ¥1,734,640 (75% of revenue)  
**Non-royalty revenue:** ¥568,000 (25% — partner keeps 100%)

### Monthly Royalty Calculation
¥1,734,640 × 2.5% = **¥43,366/month**

### Year 1 Cost Comparison

| Model | Year 1 Total | vs Norenchise |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Norenchise** | **¥3,657,093** | — |
| Wholesale (true cost) | ¥4,323,740 | +¥666,647 |
| Franchise | ¥7,324,000 | +¥3,666,907 |

## 7. Limitations & Open Questions

### Current Limitations
1. **Quality control mechanism undefined** — Relies on trust/relationship, no formal audit system
2. **Contract structure not finalized** — Term length, termination conditions, territory protection TBD
3. **Single partner test** — Model based on one partner's projections, not validated at scale
4. **Food attachment rates assumed** — 18% cake, 5% cookie based on COMMONS data, may vary

### Open Questions
1. What happens if partner underperforms quality standards?
2. How to handle partner exit/sale of location?
3. Territory protection specifics?
4. Multi-unit partner terms?
5. Minimum purchase requirements (if any)?

### Assumptions to Validate
- 18g beans per drink (weighted average)
- 18% cake attachment rate
- 5% cookie attachment rate  
- 50% takeout rate
- Partner can achieve 80 customers/day by Q4
