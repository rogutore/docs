## 1. Executive Summary

### What is Norenchise?
A hybrid café partnership model combining Japanese 暖簾分け (norenwake) tradition with modern franchise systems. The name blends "noren" (暖簾) + "franchise" = **Norenchise**.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Partners:** Lower cost than both wholesale AND franchise, with full brand/support included
- **For HQ:** 161% more profit than wholesale per partner through full product ecosystem, WITHOUT the overhead of running a traditional franchise

### Key Terms
- **Royalty:** 2.5% on Tokyo Coffee-related revenue (coffee, cakes, cookies, retail products)
- **Partnership Fee:** ¥0 (for first partner)
- **Bean Pricing:** Wholesale rate (6掛け = ¥4,920/kg)

---

## 2. The Logic: Why Royalty Actually Helps Partners

### Initial Goal
We originally wanted a royalty-free model (pure 暖簾分け style). After exhaustive financial modeling, we discovered this was actually **worse for partners**.

### The Discovery
A small royalty (2.5%) unlocks included services that would cost MORE to purchase separately under wholesale:

**Tokyo Coffee's Standard Consulting Rates:**

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Initial setup consulting | ¥400,000 |
| Barista training (5 days) | ¥125,000 |
| Menu development & recipes | ¥100,000 |
| Operations manual creation | ¥150,000 |
| Consulting/travel (monthly) | ¥360,000/year |
| Menu updates & seasonal products | ¥120,000/year |
| Marketing material updates | ¥80,000/year |
| **Total Year 1** | **¥1,335,000+** |

**With Norenchise:** All included for ~¥520,000/year (2.5% royalty)

**Net benefit to partner: ~¥815,000/year savings vs DIY**

### Why "適当" (Tekitou)
The Japanese concept of "適当" — finding the appropriate fit — guided us. The 2.5% royalty is the mathematically optimal balance where:
- Partner pays less than any alternative
- HQ earns enough to sustain support infrastructure
- Both parties have aligned incentives

## 3. Why NOT a Traditional Franchise Model

### The Hidden Costs of Running a Franchise

If Tokyo Coffee operated as a traditional franchisor, we would incur significant overhead that would need to be passed on to franchisees:

**Regulatory & Legal Compliance:**
| Item | Estimated Annual Cost |
|------|----------------------|
| Franchise disclosure document (FDD) preparation | ¥500,000-1,000,000 |
| Legal counsel (franchise law specialist) | ¥300,000-600,000/year |
| Franchise registration & renewals | ¥100,000-200,000/year |
| Contract management & updates | ¥200,000/year |
| **Subtotal** | **¥1,100,000-2,000,000/year** |

**Insurance Requirements:**
| Item | Estimated Annual Cost |
|------|----------------------|
| Franchisor liability insurance | ¥300,000-500,000/year |
| Errors & omissions insurance | ¥200,000-400,000/year |
| Directors & officers insurance | ¥150,000-300,000/year |
| **Subtotal** | **¥650,000-1,200,000/year** |

**Administrative Overhead:**
| Item | Estimated Annual Cost |
|------|----------------------|
| Franchise compliance manager (0.5 FTE) | ¥2,500,000/year |
| Franchise accounting/reporting systems | ¥500,000/year |
| Audit & inspection program | ¥300,000/year |
| Franchisee communication systems | ¥200,000/year |
| Training facility maintenance | ¥400,000/year |
| **Subtotal** | **¥3,900,000/year** |

**Marketing & Brand Management:**
| Item | Estimated Annual Cost |
|------|----------------------|
| National advertising fund management | ¥500,000/year |
| Brand standards enforcement | ¥300,000/year |
| Mystery shopper program | ¥400,000/year |
| **Subtotal** | **¥1,200,000/year** |

### Total Franchise Overhead: ¥6,850,000 - ¥8,300,000/year

**To break even on this overhead with 7% royalty:**
- Need ¥98M - ¥119M in franchisee revenue
- Or approximately 4-5 franchise locations at ¥24M/year each

**The Problem:** 
- High upfront investment required before first franchisee
- Must charge high fees to recover costs
- Creates adversarial compliance relationship
- Partner bears the cost of HQ overhead

### Norenchise Eliminates This Overhead

| Franchise Requirement | Norenchise Approach |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| FDD & legal compliance | Trust-based agreement |
| Compliance audits | Relationship-based quality |
| Franchise manager | Existing team handles support |
| Brand enforcement | Partnership alignment |
| Mystery shoppers | Direct communication |

**Result:** No franchise overhead to pass on = lower costs for partners

## 4. Royalty Structure

### What's IN the Royalty Base (2.5% applies):
- ☕ Coffee drinks (dine-in + takeout)
- 🍰 Cake sales (supplied by Tokyo Coffee)
- 🍪 Cookie sales (supplied by Tokyo Coffee)

## 5. Financial Model (Final Numbers)

### Partner's Projected Business (Q4 Run-Rate)
- **Customers:** 80/day (40 dine-in + 40 takeout)

## 6. HQ Economics

| **Total** | **¥339,590** | 100% |

### Comparison to Wholesale

| Model | Monthly HQ Profit | Annual |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Wholesale (beans only) | ¥130,268 | ¥1,563,216 |
| **Norenchise** | **¥339,590** | **¥4,075,080** |
| **Uplift** | **+161%** | **+¥2,511,864** |

### Why Norenchise is Better Than Franchise FOR HQ

| Metric | Traditional Franchise | Norenchise |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| HQ Overhead | ¥6.8-8.3M/year | ~¥0 additional |
| Break-even locations | 4-5 | 1 |
| Partner relationship | Compliance-based | Trust-based |
| Legal complexity | High | Low |
| Scalability | Slow (need infrastructure) | Fast (relationship-based) |

**Net HQ profit comparison (with 3 locations):**
- Franchise: ¥12M revenue × 7% = ¥840K royalty - ¥7M overhead = **Loss**
- Norenchise: 3 × ¥4.08M = **¥12.2M profit**

## 9. Assumptions & Limitations

### Key Assumptions
- 18g beans per drink (weighted average)
- 18% cake attachment rate
- 5% cookie attachment rate
- 50% takeout rate
- Partner achieves 80 customers/day by Q4
- Partner purchases cakes/cookies/cups from HQ (not elsewhere)

### Limitations

2. **Contract structure not finalized** — Term length, termination TBD
3. **Single partner test** — Model not validated at scale
4. **Franchise overhead estimates** — Based on industry research, not quotes

### Open Questions
1. Quality enforcement if partner underperforms?
2. Partner exit/sale process?
3. Territory protection?
4. Multi-unit terms?
